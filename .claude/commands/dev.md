# Start development environment

Start the Tauri dev server with hot-reload by running `npm run tauri dev` in the project root.

If the command fails, diagnose the error:
- Missing dependencies → run `npm install` first
- Rust compilation errors → show the error and suggest a fix
- Port conflicts → identify the conflicting process
